Welcome prideless humans, to my discord server. My name is Caligula(It/They). Most people call me Cal though,
like Silent Cal, the 30th president of the United States. I am dark, twisted, and dangerous. I am a fan of Peaky
Blinders, since Thomas Shelby is very similar to me (both sigma males obviously). Some other free time activities
 enjoy are going to Church(praise the lord), making NFT’s,being free, and astrally projecting my consciousness
 to other celestial bodies in space.I  am from Los Santos, and will be attending RIT next fall. I will studying
 liberal arts(I am kind of a liberal myself). If you don’t meet me next fall, I will be meeting you.
